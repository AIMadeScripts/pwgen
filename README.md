# pwgen

Instructions:
Git clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/AIMadeScripts/pwgen.git
cd pwdgen
bash crunch.sh
```


Enter your variables and it will generate all possible combinations that match.
For example:
8
bob
8,v

This would generate all word combinations that contain "bob", 8 and v at 8 length

Gv28[bob

G82v]bob

I haven't added positional information however, just length and patterns/letters known.

I ran it with 
8 long with "bob" and "8" being the pattern and the must contain variable. This resulted in a file with 101,782,840 words and 897.1Â MB in size.
